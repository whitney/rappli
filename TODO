USER WORKFLOW
-------------
What is the common workflow when responding to an apartment listing? 

	1. Find a listing on Craigslist
	2. Email the person who posted the listing with some basic biographic
		information about yourself (e.g. name, age, occupation, habits, etc.)
	3. Wait for reply and possibly schedule a viewing.

			* Pre-render the listing HTML and cache it. Serve it up when they click
					"view".

As you navigate listings, an icon floats next to each
		listing that looks promising. You can then add it
