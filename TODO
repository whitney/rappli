USER WORKFLOW
-------------
What is the common workflow when responding to an apartment listing? 

	1. Find a listing on Craigslist
	2. Email the person who posted the listing with some basic biographic
		information about yourself (e.g. name, age, occupation, habits, etc.)
	3. Wait for reply and possibly schedule a viewing.
